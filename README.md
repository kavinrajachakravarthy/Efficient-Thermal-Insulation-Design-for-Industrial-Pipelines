# Efficient Thermal Insulation Design for Industrial Pipelines

This project presents an Excel-based heat transfer and economic analysis to determine
the economic insulation thickness for hot fluid pipelines.

## Objective
To minimize total annual cost by optimizing insulation thickness considering:
- Heat loss from insulated pipes
- Energy loss cost
- Insulation material cost

## Methodology
- Radial heat transfer analysis for cylindrical insulation
- Parametric study using MS Excel
- Energy loss and insulation cost estimation
- Solver-based optimization to identify economic insulation thickness

## Tools Used
- MS Excel (formulas, charts, Solver)
- Heat Transfer Theory (Incropera, Çengel)
- Economic optimization principles

## Key Results
- Heat loss decreases logarithmically with insulation thickness
- Insulation cost increases with thickness
- Total cost curve exhibits a minimum
- Minimum point defines economic insulation thickness

## Repository Structure
- `excel/` : Excel calculations with Solver optimization
-  Presentation slides
